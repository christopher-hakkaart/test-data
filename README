# gm24385_q20_2021.10/chr20.v3

This is a subset (chr20) of the October 2021 GM24385 Q20+ Simplex Dataset (`gm24385_q20_2021.10`)
used for testing the combined wf-human-variation Nextflow pipeline, release 3.

You can check the integrity of your download with the `md5sum` command (if available):

    md5sum -c md5sums.txt

An unaligned BAM (uBAM) can be generated with the following command:

    samtools bam2fq demo.bam -t | samtools import -T '*' - -o demo.ubam --output-fmt bam

The tandem repeat annotation BED was downloaded from the Sniffles2 github repository:
https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/tree/master/annotations

## Updates
- v3, 2022-09-28: Removed non-chr20 SQ lines from BAM to prevent cram_get_ref error
- v2, 2022-07-25: Added tandem repeat annotation BED and guidance for creating uBAM
